# Episode 4

further complicate matters

mindless panic

For instance

plastic

your lift passes before your eyes

throw away

feel free to mention my brush with death in the note

you had a medical emergency

comic book

I outgrew picture books when i was three

I'm afraid i'll choke again

shaking him upside down 

It's too risky

At least drink you milk

solid foods

fragile little boy

he's divorcee

you stopped coddling him

a lot to accomplish 

you and i have a little rap session

Shelly is incredibly bright

Sheldon and i happen to have a lot in common

you making it depressing 

I was on a mission

back bin in the corner

Instead 

had a weakness 

every superhero had a weakness, something they had to overcome through an extraordinary act of courage

I would not be defeated

Just like that i overcome my fear of choking
