# Episode 8

you are awful

you can't always leave him out

i hate to tall you, that ball is already pretty odd

something a little more active

Three Cooper boys on a little adventure

you are catching on

her allowance

I'll turn them inside out

sit up front for a change

I actually prefer sitting in the back  

I called shotgun

Drive safe

i am very much fun

have a conversation

thought experiment, A cat in a box is exposed to poison, and is both alive and dead until it is observed

Otherwise, his tombstone

Not your day

I raised myself like a jungle child

stop being so dramatic

I'd rather not touch him

you throw of a lot off heat

cheer me up

pretend to be dumb

the best trap i ever had
